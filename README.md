# ThreatEye â€“ AI-Driven Supply Chain Attack Detection Simulator

## ðŸš€ Overview
**ThreatEye** is an **AI-driven cybersecurity simulation tool** that demonstrates how organizations can detect and respond to **supply chain attacks** in real time.  
Our prototype simulates the monitoring of software updates, detecting anomalies, and providing instant alerts â€” allowing security teams to stop potential breaches before they cause damage.

This project was built as part of a hackathon/business pitch to showcase the **concept, workflow, and future vision** of an intelligent threat detection system.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
Modern organizations rely on multiple third-party vendors, APIs, and plugins. If even one vendorâ€™s update is compromised, it can serve as a backdoor for cybercriminals.  
Traditional security tools often fail to detect **zero-day supply chain attacks** until itâ€™s too late.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Solution â€“ ThreatEye
ThreatEye continuously monitors software updates and system activity.  
It uses **machine learning anomaly detection** to:
- Learn normal update patterns.
- Flag unusual or suspicious behavior.
- Instantly notify the security team and halt the process.

Our simulation demonstrates this end-to-end detection process with a user-friendly interface.

## ðŸ”‘ Features
- **Real-time simulation** of a supply chain attack detection.
- **AI-powered anomaly detection logic** (conceptual for now in simulation).
- **Interactive UI** showing alerts, logs, and update status.
- **Risk scoring system** to prioritize threats.
- **Instant alert notifications** to the dashboard.
